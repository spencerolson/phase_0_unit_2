# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# I implemented the map! and each methods. The map! method
# evaluates the code between the curly brackets and replaces
# the element with the value that is evaluated. By using the bang(!)
# we're sure that we're modifying the actual array. With the hash method
# I used .each and then used hash[key] = value to alter the actual value of
# the hash.
